# Planning Documentation

### Ideas

 - **Recommendation app**: Users can submit what anime they have watched and are recommended new similar anime. Can also leave comments on anime. 
 - **Search Engine**: Users can search through various anime and can save the anime they have watched. 
 - **Gallery/inventory app**: Users upload image? title? of sewing patterns and/or fabric they own. Issue with patterns would be getting the image of the pattern w/o uploading pattern entirely. 
 - **Gallery/Review app**: Users upload images of finished sewing projects, and images of the fabric they used, fabric type. Can post reviews of the pattern/ fabric.  They type the pattern name but can link it too. 

 ### Selected Idea
 Moving forward with the anime search engine.

### Background Research
Steps I need to take
1. **Design**
    - Wireframes how the app will look like
    - How the database collections will look like
2.  **Dataset** 
    -   Locate an appropriate dataset that has user ratings and anime list [Found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database)
    -   Import Dataset to MongoDB
    -
3. Build the back end
4. Build the front end
5. Implement CI/CD
6. Deploy
7. Get peer reviews

### Decision
First version of the app will be a standard search engine. Second version will allow creation of user accounts. Third version, if I have time, will be to add the ability to create a watchlist.
